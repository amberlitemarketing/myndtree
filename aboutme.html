											<h2>About Me</h2>
											<p>All about who I am</p>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>I started my career after motherhood. I am a happy mother of two daughters. With above average intelligence, both my children were independent at a very early age, and I started my studies. I did my masters in psychology in 2008, pursuing a PG Diploma in Guidance and Counselling.</p>
										<p>In 2010, I quickly got a lot of work opportunities during my education journey, so I worked as a freelancer. I went on to study TA101 (Basic Level), and received  Certification in Remedial Therapy for Learning Disabilities, Behavior Therapy, Relaxation Training and Techniques, and Cognitive Therapy. I am a Yoga and Mindfulness Practitioner, which I also apply in my therapies.</p>
										<p>When I completed my masters in psychology, I was looking for a unique field where I could make a difference. Just then, I came across a special school that was hiring teachers for children with learning disabilities and slow learners. I worked there, and, gradually, the work became a passion. I could see the difference I was making in the lives of children and their parents. These children were dropouts from the mainstream, as they could not cope up with the syllabus. After that, I started my own Mynd Tree Learning center and since then, there has been no looking back.</p>
										<p>I approached schools and gave an overview of my work and how it would be helpful to children, teachers, and the school. The teachers don't have to take on an extra burden, and at the same time the child also benefits from specialized training. This in turn starts boosting their self-esteem and self-confidence. </p>
										<p>Now, I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Special Education. I try to bring out the joy of learning and aim to reach out to as many as I can. Meanwhile, I also started learning other modalities of psychotherapy and started working in the area of individual therapy. Mynd Tree is now a Psychological and Educational counseling centre with a network of various experienced groups of psychologists, counselors and educational consultants.</p>
										<p>It has been a decade long journey in terms of work experience. Struggles and challenges are a part of my work. It is a blessing to be working with children with different challenges. I have trained children with learning disabilities in many areas with an empathetic approach. I never stopped believing in them. That was the secret I could move on in this field.</p>
